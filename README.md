# blank_creative_for_CDN

## Image CDN
First upload the required images in asset manager. Then upload the richload of this repo and then create a new creative by uploading the basefile. In the new creative populate the image variables with the required images. Then approve the creative.<br>
Now the cdn link for the images would be https://cdn.flashtalking.com/{library_id}/instantAssets/{image_name}<br>
For example: https://cdn.flashtalking.com/165090/instantAssets/Bg_Alabama_300x250.png
