# blank_creative_for_CDN
Same base file and richload can be used for multiple image and fonts.

## Image CDN
First upload the required images in asset manager. Then upload the richload of this repo and then create a new creative by uploading the basefile. In the new creative populate the image variables with the required images. Then approve the creative.<br>
Now the cdn link for the images would be https://cdn.flashtalking.com/{library_id}/instantAssets/{image_name}<br>
For example: https://cdn.flashtalking.com/165090/instantAssets/Bg_Alabama_300x250.png


## Font CDN
Place your font in this richload and the upload the richload in asset manager. Then create a new creative by uploading the basefile. Then approve the creative.<br>
Now the CDN link for the font would be https://cdn.flashtalking.com/{library_id}/{Name_of-the-richload(image_font_cdn_rl)}/{font}<br>
For example https://cdn.flashtalking.com/165090/image_font_cdn_rl/Means-Medium.woff
